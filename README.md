# Data Analysis

This directory contains a collection of signal processing and analysis projects. Each script focuses on a different aspect of data analysis, primarily in audio and biomedical signals.

## Contents

- **Audio Signal Analysis Using Power Spectral Density**  
  Analyze audio signals by computing their power spectral density, which helps in understanding the frequency components present in the signals.

- **Distance Metrics Comparison between Two Signals**  
  Compare two signals using various distance metrics to quantify their similarity or difference.

- **ECG Signal**  
  Process and analyze ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals for biomedical applications, such as detecting heartbeats or identifying signal abnormalities.

- **Heartbeat Detection Using Cross-Correlation**  
  Detect heartbeats in biomedical signals using cross-correlation techniques, which measure similarity between segments of the signal.

- **Voice Signal Filtering with IIR and FIR Filters**  
  Apply Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) and Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters to voice signals to improve quality or remove noise.

## Getting Started

Each script can be run independently. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (such as `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, etc.) before executing the scripts.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `Data Analysis` directory.
3. Run the desired script according to your analysis need.
